  # * WRITE a multiple word test for the braille output
  # 1. input English words from text file

  #   B. match to key(letter) to value
  #   C. output braille(value) on three lines
  # 3. output braille to text file
      A. create method/class to print translated word to .txt file
#     B. collect each braille character to write to file
# test_split = converter.line_one.scan(/.{1,160}/).join("\n")


# 3B
# Braille to English translation
#   1. input Braille characters from Braille text file
#     A. invert collection to switch values for keys
      B. grab each line of braille characters to an array
